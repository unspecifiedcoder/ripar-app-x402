// This was the workspace's mock data layer. Every table that shows a number now
// reads lib/real-data — the deployed agent's own manifest, and the chain — so
// the sample ENDPOINTS, AGENTS, RUNS, SAMPLE_CALLERS and month totals had been
// orphaned for a while: nothing outside this file imported them.
//
// Dead sample data is not harmless, which is why it is deleted rather than left
// tidy. It carried USDC_ASSET_ID = "31566704" and X402_NETWORK =
// "algorand-mainnet" — MAINNET values, sitting in an app that settles on TestNet
// with asset 10458941. Unreferenced today, and precisely the constant someone
// reaches for when wiring up the next view, at which point the workspace would
// quote an asset it cannot settle in.
//
// What remains is what is actually used: the shared TYPES (Endpoint, Agent, Run
// and friends are the shape lib/real-data returns), STEP_KIND_IDS, STATUS_TONE,
// the `usd`/`compact`/`costOfSteps` helpers, and WORKFLOWS — starter templates
// the builder offers, which state plainly that they have never run.
