/**
 * What the chat is actually asked, and what it can actually do about it.
 *
 * Chat used to ignore its input. Every message — "price my summariser", "what
 * is the capital of Peru" — ran the same POST at the same endpoint and narrated
 * the same 402 back, under a footer promising "nothing is scripted". The
 * numbers in that reply were real, which is what made it worse: a confident,
 * correctly-sourced answer to a question nobody asked reads as a working
 * assistant right up until you type one off-script sentence, and then every
 * other honest claim on the page becomes suspect too.
 *
 * So the routing is the fix, and the honest branch is the important half. Each
 * intent below performs a DIFFERENT real request and answers from what came
 * back. Anything this workspace cannot do falls to `unsupported`, which says so
 * and names what it can — rather than reaching for the one action it has and
 * dressing the result up as an answer.
 *
 * There is no model behind this and the copy does not pretend there is. It is a
 * router over four live data sources, which is a smaller claim than "assistant"
 * and one that survives being tested.

 * by how much they actually identify a SUBJECT. "escrowed", "settled" and
 * "registered" name what is being asked about; "how much" only names the shape
 * of the question and is worth far less. Ties fall to `unsupported`, because
