/**
 * Running a workflow, for real.
 *
 * This replaced a setInterval that walked the chain a step at a time and then
 * recorded `outcome: "ok"` with a cost summed from the static `price` fields on
 * the steps. Nothing was ever requested. The copy around it was careful —
 * "walked", "quotes" rather than "cost" — but a timer that reports success for
 * work it never attempted is a simulation of a run, and the one thing a run has
 * to be is real.
 *
 * What happens now: a `call` step issues an actual HTTP request to an actual
 * endpoint from the deployed agent's published manifest, with no payment header
 * attached. The endpoint is x402-gated, so the correct answer is 402 carrying a
 * base64 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` challenge, and the price this run reports is decoded
 * from that challenge — the server's number, at the moment it was asked, not the
 * number sitting in the template.
 *
 * The other step kinds do not execute, and are reported as not executed rather
 * than animated. A trigger has no backend to fire, a condition has nothing to
 * evaluate against, and an onchain action needs a signer this workspace does not
 * have yet. Marking them "ok" because time passed is the failure mode this file
 * exists to avoid.
